Hello! I'm Iasonas Kakandris. I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student working on my thesis. I like going out, listening to music, working out and learning about programmin tools and apps that can make my everyday life easier and more independent from the mainstream apps. I recently started working on self hosting and playing with my raspberry pi. I will update about my projects, learning journey and hobbies here. I hope you like it! âœ¨
