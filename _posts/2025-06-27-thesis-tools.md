Hello my fellow students (and not). This time i decided to write about something that really struggles me for 9 months now. Thesis: A whole project that a master student needs to do in order to get his/her degree. It includes, a project (either a research or a more technical one), the thesis itself which is a 70-ish page document in which you write what you did, what did other people do up until now, theory in which you explain core concepts that your thesis is based upon, your implementations (whether that is a theoretical development or a practical explanation on what you developed), results and future development, and maybe a paper which is a brief explanation of your work that you can present ona forum.

In this article, I thought of naming a few tools that have helped me thus far with the development of my project and the writing of my thesis.

My thesis is a more technical one. I am developing a DSL for machine learning in live data. I am naming it beaver!!! I will write about it on another blog post because i am really proud of my work and i want to help other people working with machine learning algorithms. So, these tools might not help everyone, it is more tailored towards software engineering students, but I hope some of them can really be helpful to every students battling with his/her thesis. So without further ado, here are my thesis tools!

## Notion

First on our list is [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). Notion is a cloud Note taking app, with a lot of layouts and multiple features. You write on Markdown and you can create pages, bullets, add embedded frames and many more. You can also collaborate with other people and publish your page! There is a free plan as well as paid plans. Me personally, the free plan fully covers me so i don't need to pay for any features. I am mainly using it for keeping track of my sources, my progress and showing my questions to my teachers for further explanations. Furthermore, i keep notes (shocking) from videos, tutorials and documentation pages i study in order to solve any problems i have encountered thus far. I also use for other stuff, like notes for my courses, some supermarket chores and i have also used it as a collaborative tool when i was working at SpaceDot. It can really simplify your note taking tasks so i highly recommend it. There are also some other tools similar to Notion like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which might suit you more.

## Git(hub)

Coming up next on No.2 is Git and specifically [GitHub](https://github.com/). Git is a software, more specifically a version control software that lets you track changes of your files over time. GitHub is a platform in which you can upload your code and keep track of the changes you do. GitHub is a platform where you can find other projects, download them, report issues and connect with other developers. But for our case is tool that helps us developing our project. How many times have you created a final_final_final file that in the end it wasn't the final one? How many times have you forgotten to save your file or even worse, lost it? How many times have you wanted to use another computer and you couldn't because you didn't have your project? Well fear not my fellow engineer, these problems are no more. With git you can keep track of your development, create new branches in which you can work on a new project without interfearing with the main development branch (thus maybe breaking it) and even more, you can collaborate with other people on different features without creating problems one another. If you don't want to use GitHub there is also [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). You can also publish your work and serve it through GitHub. This whole blog is served on GitHub! And most importantly, you can showcase your work, which is really important when you start searching for a job. I firmly believe that this tool is essential for any software engineer and generally anyone working with developing code.
